Description: Explore projections of boreal caribou population growth overtime based on 
    demographic rates determined from provided recruitment and survival data. 
    Demographic rates are estimated using the caribouMetrics and bboutools 
    packages to build a Basyesian population model. Uncertainty in projected 
    population growth incorporates the uncertainty in extimated demographic 
    rates and interannual variation.
