# Run the Caribou Demography App

To run the app:

  1. Download caribou_demography_app.tar to your computer.
  2. Unzip the file by right clicking on caribou_demography_app.tar and
     selecting "Extract all".
  3. Click "Browse" in the dialog box that opens to choose a location to store
     the app files, then click "Extract".
  4. Go to the location where you extracted the files and double click on the
     file "run.bat".

This will open a command prompt window. Just leave that window open and wait, the
app should open in your default internet browser within a few minutes. The
command prompt window will close when you close the browser window.
