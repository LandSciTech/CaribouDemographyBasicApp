Projected adult female population size over time. The darker line shows the outcome if we ignore uncertainty about demographic rates and variation among years. The paler lines show a variety of plausible outcomes given uncertainty about demographic rates and variation among years. Only the female population is shown because it is assumed that the number of females is what limits population growth. The population is considered stable if the line is flat or sloped upwards and is declining if the line slopes downward.,"Projected adult female population size over time. The thicker line shows the outcome without considering any uncertainty. The paler lines show a variety of outcomes that include uncertainty about female survival rates, number of calves per 100 cows, and yearly variation.   Only the female population is shown since the number of females is what limits population growth. The population is considered stable if the line is flat or sloped up and is shrinking if the line slopes down."

The survey area or time spent surveying may differ from year to year so the numbers should not be directly compared from one year to the next. These values are used by the model to estimate the ratios of males to females and females to calves in the population.","Note, this graph displays the number of animals counted in aerial surveys in each year.
