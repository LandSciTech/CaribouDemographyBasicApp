- **% Female survival:** 
The estimated percentage of adult female caribou (cows) that survive each year.
For example, if survival is 85%, that means about 85 out of 100 adult females 
live from one year to the next.

- **Calves per 100 cows:** 
The estimated number of calves seen for every 100 adult females during aerial 
surveys.
These surveys usually happen about 9 months after calves are born, so the number 
includes calves (male and female) that survived most of their first year.

- **% Female mortality:** 
The estimated percentage of adult females that die each year.
For example, if 85 out of 100 female caribou survive and 15 die, then mortality is 15%.

- **Female replacement rate:** 
The estimated number of female calves that survive at least 9 months for every 
100 adult females.
If the number of new female calves (replacement) is about the same as the number
of females that die (mortality), the population stays about the same size.
If fewer female calves are born and survive almost a year than the adult females
that die, the population will likely decline over time.

- **Years to < 10 females:** 
An estimate of how many years it might take for the number of adult females
in the population to drop below 10 – a level called “quasi-extinction.”
This number helps identify when a population could be at increased risk of 
extinction because of a small population size .
The 10-female threshold follows a national guideline from
[Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2011](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/ec/CW66-296-2011-eng.pdf).

- **Recruitment rate:**
How many young caribou survive to the winter survey, usually measured as the number
of surviving calves per 100 adult females.

- **Recruit:**
A young caribou that has survived its first year (or another defined early life stage)
