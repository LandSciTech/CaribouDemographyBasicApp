**Why is only the female population reported?**  
The models used to make these projections do not incorporate changes to the male
population. Typically, only females are collared and therefore we only have
information on the survival rate for females. The assumption is that there are
enough males present in the population for all females to find a mate. We also
assume that half the calves will be female.
