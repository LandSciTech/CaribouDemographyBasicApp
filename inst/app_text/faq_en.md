**Why don't we project changes in the population of males?**  
It is common for caribou population viability projection models to include only calves of both sexes and adult females (i.e. cows), not bulls. The assumption is that there are enough bulls to allow cows to find mates. Often, only cows are collared so we lack information on the survival rate of bulls. We assume that half of calves are male.
