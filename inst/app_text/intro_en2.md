##### **Purpose** {#intro-purpose}

<img align="right" src="www/Female_caribou_and_calves.jpg" width="500">
This app helps people explore what might happen to boreal caribou populations 
over time. It shows possible future trends – whether caribou numbers might go up, 
down, or stay about the same – based on the information we have right now.

The app uses data that scientists have already collected and published – such as:

-  How many female caribou with tracking collars have survived each year
-  How many calves (caribou less than one year old) have been seen with adult 
females during winter aerial surveys (recruitment)

Using this information, **the app estimates the “survival rate” and “recruitment rate”
for the whole female population across all the years of data available. Then the
app uses these rates to estimate what might happen to the female population
in the future if survival and recruitment stay about the same.**

The app also lets you test out different “what-if” scenarios – for example, what
might happen if more adult females survive each year, or if more calves are born
and survive to the winter survey.

The app runs a model that creates a graph showing how the caribou population might
change over time. You’ll see **the average expected trend, and several different 
possible outcomes.**

These different outcomes reflect that we can’t be completely sure about the current
number of caribou or how their numbers will change in the future. This is what we
mean by **“uncertainty”** in the model – it shows a range of possible futures. Note 
that not all sources of uncertainty about the future are included in this model.
Future landscape and climate changes will affect caribou, but those changes are
not included. This simple model shows possible futures if conditions remain the 
same for caribou.

The amount of uncertainty depends on how much information you give the model to 
base the predictions on. When the model has less data, there’s more uncertainty.
When it has more data, you can be more confident about the results.

In the future, we plan to include tools that also use **knowledge about the 
disturbance on the landscape** to further decrease this uncertainty.

You can upload or add your own data for your area of interest. **This lets your 
community or organization explore how changes in survival and recruitment rates
might affect your local caribou population over time.**
