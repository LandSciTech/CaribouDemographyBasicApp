**Why don’t we show population predictions for male caribou (bulls)?**

Most models that predict future caribou populations focus on adult females (cows)
and calves. This is because female caribou are the ones that give birth and raise
new calves, which has the biggest effect on whether the population grows or shrinks.

We don’t usually have much data on males (bulls), since tracking collars are most
often put on females. But we assume there are usually enough males for females to
find mates each year.

When the app estimates calf numbers, it assumes about half of the calves are male
and half are female.
