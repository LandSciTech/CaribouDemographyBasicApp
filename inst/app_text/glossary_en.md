- **% Female survival:** The estimated percentage of adult females that survive each year on average.
  
- **Calves per 100 cows:** The estimated number of calves per 100 observed cows, on average. Calves are
  observed during aerial surveys typically conducted ~ 9 months after calving so
  this includes both male and female calves that survived most of their first year of life.
  
- **% Female mortality:** The estimated percentage of adult females that die each year on average. 
  Calculated as 100 minus % female survival. 

- **Female replacement rate:** The estimated number of female calves per 100 cows that were alive at the beginning of the year.
  When female replacement rate is equal to female mortality the population is stable.

- **Years to < 10 females:** Number of years until the population reaches quasi-extinction.
  10 females was chosen as the threshold for quasi-extinction to follow [ECCC
  2011](https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/ec/CW66-296-2011-eng.pdf).
